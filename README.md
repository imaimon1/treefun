# treefun
fun with trees. I was reading some lecture notes about algorithms for on scheduling jobs on a machine, 
and I realized this is very similar to finding a path through a directed tree with maximum weight.
I never dealt with maximum weight questions (not even min weight questions with weights less then zero),
so I decided to make some code for it.

note: code is not fully tested and might have some bugs
